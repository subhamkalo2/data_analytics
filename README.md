# 🏏 IPL Data Analytics Project

## 📌 Overview
This project is a **comprehensive data analytics study of the Indian Premier League (IPL)**.  
Using Python and various data science libraries, the project analyzes IPL datasets to uncover insights, patterns, and trends in players’ performances, teams’ strategies, and match outcomes.  

---

## 🔑 Objectives
- Clean and preprocess IPL datasets.  
- Perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**.  
- Visualize player and team performance.  
- Identify top players, teams, and match insights.  
- Answer cricket-related analytical questions.  

---

## 📊 Features & Analysis
- **Data Cleaning** → Handling missing values, correcting datatypes.  
- **Team Analysis** → Win rates, toss decisions, batting vs. fielding stats.  
- **Player Analysis** → Top run scorers, wicket-takers, strike rates, economy.  
- **Match Insights** → Venue performance, home vs. away matches.  
- **Visualization** → Bar plots, heatmaps, pie charts, trend analysis.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Language**: Python 3  
- **Libraries**:  
  - pandas  
  - numpy  
  - matplotlib  
  - seaborn  
  - plotly (optional)  
  - jupyter
